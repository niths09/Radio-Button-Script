# RadioButton Selenium Automation Project

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium WebDriver for automating the interaction with radio buttons on a practice webpage. The script navigates to a URL, selects three different radio buttons (BMW, Benz, and Honda), and introduces short delays to simulate user interactions and ensure that the user can observe each action.

## Features
- Automates the selection of radio buttons (BMW, Benz and Honda) on a practice webpage.
- Uses **WebDriverWait** for explicit waiting to ensure elements are clickable before interacting.
- Introduces short delays between interactions to simulate real user actions.
- Uses **Selenium 4.25.0** and **Java** for the automation process.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Java**: Install Java on your machine (can check using `java -version`).
2. **Selenium WebDriver**: Install Selenium WebDriver (via Maven or Gradle).
3. **ChromeDriver**: Download the correct version of ChromeDriver from [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and make sure it’s in your system’s PATH or set it programmatically.
4. **IDE**: Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or any other Java-supported IDE.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language used for the automation script.
- **Selenium 4.25.0**: WebDriver for automating browser actions.
- **ChromeDriver**: Driver to control the Chrome browser.
